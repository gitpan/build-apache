This is the build-apache script with a generic.conf configuration file.

This is not currently being maintained, but if you have patches for bugs or
improvements, send them to jsmith@cpan.org.  If there is an interest in it
being maintained, the fixes will be incorporated and a new tar file
rolled.


Some or all of the following might be standard Perl modules.  They are all
required for the script to work.

   Cwd
   Getopt::Std
   IniConf
   Net::FTP
   Sys::Hostname

See comments in the generic.conf file for configuration directions.

build-apache will try to download all the pieces of software required to
build apache with mod_perl, mod_php, and mod_ssl (depending on the
configuration).  Some of the locations may be stale.  Feel free to update
or e-mail corrections.
